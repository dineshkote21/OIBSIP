                        <p>Mangal Pandey was an Indian soldier who played a key part in the events immediately preceding the outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857. He was a sepoy in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry regiment of the British East India Company. In 1984, the Indian government issued a postage stamp to remember him</p>

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Mangal Pandey was born in Nagwa, a village of upper Ballia district, Ceded and Conquered Provinces (now in Uttar Pradesh), to a Hindu Brahmin family.

                    Mangal Pandey had joined the Bengal Army in 1849. In March 1857, he was a private soldier (sepoy) in the 5th Company of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry.</p>   
                    <p>The personal motivation behind Mangal Pandey's behaviour remains confused. During the incident itself he shouted to other sepoys: "come out â€“ the Europeans are here"; "from biting these cartridges we shall become infidels" and "you sent me out here, why don't you follow me". At his court-martial,
                         he stated that he had been taking bhang and opium, and was not conscious of his actions on 29 March</p> </article>
